### ABOUT ME 🙋🏻

Hello, I'm Hyunwoo Kim. A XR developer (in progress) from Seoul, Korea.

During my college life, I studied web development using Spring and Django. Thanks to my professor, I had a chance to worked on a national IoT project which was to solve accidents that happen in the industrial site. I also recorded over 20 episodes of educational videos for students at my school. I was a hard-working student. :D 

After graduation, my interest gravitated towards VR. So, I made a decision to study VR using Unity. I studied at my good buddy's half-basement one room officetel for about 7 months. I enjoyed every moment. I fell asleep excied, thinking about what I will be creating the next day. Looking back, it was one of the best things that could ever happen to me.

The next phase of my journey awaits. I recently graduated from the VR course winning the best project award. I learned a lot from my teacher, not just programming but also, life. I made good friends along the way that I can't find anywhere else. I am fueled by positive energy from the people around me. My boundless enthusiasm tells me to keep learning and never stop challenging.

Now, I want to continue to create and develop as a XR developer.

안녕하세요

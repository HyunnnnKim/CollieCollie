### ABOUT ME 🙋🏻

Annyeong Haseyo (Hello), my name is Hyunwoo Kim, an XR developer (in progress) from Seoul, Korea.

While in college, I had several opportunities to develop my interest in web development. I studied Spring and Django. Plus, I worked on a national IoT project with a professor to solve accidents that happen in industrial sites. In addition to my coursework, I recorded over 20 educational videos to facilitate learning for students in my department.

Upon graduation, I began looking into Unity for VR and thus, recently completed a VR course with recognition for the Best Project award.

Looking back, practicing VR wasn’t so easy. My friend and I had to start it from scratch in a small studio apartment. However, I treasure every moment from the beginning to the end. Without such experience, I wouldn’t have been able to be the person I am today. I have also met a lot of good people, including my VR teacher. Not only that, I was able to expand my perspectives in programming but also about life in general. To this moment, I have made many encouraging friends that I can’t find elsewhere.

I am thrilled to learn beyond my knowledge and to continue challenging myself for further development in this field. I welcome you on my journey to becoming an enthusiastic XR developer.
